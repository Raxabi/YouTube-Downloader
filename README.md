# YutLoader, a simple YouTube Downloader using the famous python library pytube by Raxabi :)
# How to use it?
> Note: Obviously you must have installed git
>
> Anyway, if you dont want to install git you can Download with zip from GitHub too

## It's very simple, just clone the repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/Raxabi/YouTube-Downloader.git
```

### After you had cloned it, just run the python script

If you are in Windows, in my case it look something like this:
```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\Raxapaxo\Desktop\Python\YouTube-Downloader> python YutLoader.py
```
> "C:\Users\Raxapaxo\Desktop\Python\YouTube-Downloader" replaced by the path where you are in that moment

If you are a Linux Enjoyer like me, it look something like this:
```bash
Raxabi@ArchPC /home/raxabi/docs/python/ $ python YutLoader.py
```
> Note: Sometimes python are called python3 in Linux too

## After, follow the instructions in the program, soon will be available in english too :D

## Very soon I will add a CLI tool using argparse from the stdlib of python to use this program much easily this program :)

### I had uploaded this repo to github to have it accessible if I change my PC or if Im using another PC on another place
### But I will be updating this repo with my own youtube downloader library using requests
